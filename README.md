## 🪨📄✂️ **Rock Paper Scissors** – JavaScript Mini Game

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This was my first GitHub project, created around 4–5 months ago during the early stage of my JavaScript learning journey.

The purpose of this project was to understand basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and core JavaScript concepts by building a small interactive game.

## How the Game Logic Works

- The computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors using Math.random()
- Math.floor() is used to convert the random number into an array index
- The user selects an option by clicking a button
- Both choices are compared using predefined win, lose, and draw conditions
- Scores and result messages are updated dynamically in the UI

## What I Learned From This Project

- Using Math.random() and Math.floor() to generate random values
- Writing conditional logic for game rules
- Handling user interactions with event listeners
- Updating the DOM dynamically
- Organizing JavaScript code using functions

This project helped me gain confidence in JavaScript fundamentals and encouraged me to build more projects.
